> This is a website where I display a work portfolio and information about me for potential employers. This was the second UNCC coding bootcamp exercise, focusing on CSS. Writing the CSS from scratch was a major challenge as it is far more inter-connected than the VBA and html I had worked with before. In the process, I learned 1) best practices for using classes as opposed to semantic tags, 2) the importance of using sizing percentages instead of fixed px for smaller screens and media devices, and 3) the helpfulness of wireframing.
