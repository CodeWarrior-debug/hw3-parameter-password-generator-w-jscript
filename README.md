# # hw3-parameter-password-generator-w-jscript
> This is a password generator which a user can set their own preferred length and content settings for. My 3rd UNCC web dev bootcamp assignment, it went well - I like Javascript a lot better than HTML or CSS. In the process I used the debugging console in Chrome DevTools, which I really think should be demo'd in class. There were many learnings about JavaScript quirks - variables being case sensitive, the replace function only replacing one item in a string by default, the built in variable incr/decr-ementer with ++ and --. Javascript will be one of my favorite languages I'm sure.

## Development Tasks Performed
- Wrote approximately 150 lines of javascript code.
- Moved from a method of using a multiselect list of password settings to using confirm prompts.
- Added validation tests that were not "canned," notifying of problems through alerts.
- Used modulus to hit the exact number of chosen characters when the chosen number did not divide evenly into the number of settings selected.
- ...And Many More...
